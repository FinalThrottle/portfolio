            <p class="one">Hi there! My name is Alex Lam, and you have somehow
              stumbled upon my portfolio page! I wanted to take this time to welcome
              you and thank you for visiting. At the moment, there is a lot of
              construction that is occuring with the website, however little by little,
              it will head into the direction of becoming something unique that will also
              display the things that I'm learning in HTML5 100A. So check back once in awhile,
              and you might discover something new each time.
            </p>

            <p class="onehalf">I currently don't have much to offer. So here's a
            picture of the time I hiked Bukhansan Mountain in South Korea --

            the rocks of a mountain called Bukhansan. This was taken in 2018, in South Korea.
            The background has been edited to have a purple hue, making the sky emit a violet tone.">

            <p>February 18, 2019 - In the process of learning pseudo, attribute, and NTH selectors.
            It's interesting to learn how each can really help create your website.

            I'm learning a lot each week within this course. I can't wait to see
            what I am capable of at the end of this quarter.
