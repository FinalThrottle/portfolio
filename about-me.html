          <h3>So who is Alex Lam?</h3>
          <p>Hello! If you've somehow stumbled upon my portfolio, you must also
            be curious to know who I am. My name is Alex, and I am an alumni of the
            University of Washington, graduated in 2015. At first, I was in pursuit of
            a career in the medical field. However, after working in the inpatient setting,
            it turns out that it was something that I did not want to pursue afterall.</p>

          <p>As a kid, I somewhat dabbled into the world of coding. I was obsessed with the idea of
            creating a website, and making it look as stunning as possible - it evolved into a fan site
            for a video game. However, I faced an obstacle. There were limitations of what 12 year old
            me could do. I just didn't understand anything beyond HTML, and because of that, I abandoned
            the world of creating visually stunning websites. So here I am again, 13 years later,
            diving into the world of coding and creating websites once more.</p>
